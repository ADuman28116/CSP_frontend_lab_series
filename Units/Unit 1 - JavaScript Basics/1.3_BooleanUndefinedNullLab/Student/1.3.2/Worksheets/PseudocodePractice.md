# Pseudocode Practice â€” Lab 1.3 (Booleans, Undefined, and Null)

Write pseudocode for a program that:

1. Asks for a user's name (simulate with a variable).
2. If the name is undefined, log "Name missing."
3. If the name is null, log "Name cleared."
4. Otherwise, log "Welcome back!"

Then describe what Boolean checks you would use.
