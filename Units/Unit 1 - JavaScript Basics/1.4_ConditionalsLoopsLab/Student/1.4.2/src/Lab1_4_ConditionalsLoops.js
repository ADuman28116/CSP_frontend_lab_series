   Lab 1.4 â€“ Conditionals and Loops
   Practicing conditional statements and loops.
   =========================================================== */

// TODO: Part A â€“ Conditionals
// 1. Create a variable 'temperature' and assign a number value.
// 2. Write an if/else statement that prints:
//    - "It's hot!" if temperature > 85
//    - "It's mild." if between 60 and 85
//    - "It's cold!" otherwise
// 3. Add an else-if for exactly 100 that prints "Boiling point!"
// 4. Create a variable 'grade' (Aâ€“F) and print "Pass" if grade is not F.
// 5. Reflect in a comment: Why is the order of conditions important?

// TODO: Part B â€“ Loops
// 6. Write a for loop that counts from 1â€“5 and prints each number.
// 7. Write a while loop that counts down from 3 to 1, printing each number.
// 8. Add a loop that prints only even numbers from 2â€“10.
// 9. Use break to stop a loop early when i == 5.
// 10. Reflect in a comment: Which loop felt easier and why?

/* ===========================================================
   ðŸŽŸ EXIT TICKET
   1. Which conditional structure felt most natural (if/else vs else if)?
   2. Whatâ€™s one situation where youâ€™d use a while loop instead of a for loop?
   3. Describe a real-world process that could be modeled with a loop.
