# Lab 1.2 – Data Types

## 🎯 Learning Goals (I can…)
- I can identify and use JavaScript primitive data types.
- I can check types with `typeof` and explain common results.
- I can convert values explicitly with `Number()`, `String()`, and `Boolean()`.

## 📖 Pre-Lab
Read the attached PDF: **1_2_Data_Types.pdf**.

## 🧰 Setup
1. Open this lab in VS Code.
2. Open `src/index.html` in Chrome; use DevTools → Console.
3. Edit only: `src/Lab1_2_DataTypes.js`.

## 📝 Tasks
Complete the TODOs in `src/Lab1_2_DataTypes.js` (primitives, typeof, concat vs addition, conversions, NaN, template literals).

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Explore `parseInt()` vs `Number()` with different strings.
- Test `Boolean("")`, `Boolean("0")`, `Boolean("false")` and note results.

## 🎟 Exit Ticket
Answer the questions in the comment footer at the bottom of the JS file.
