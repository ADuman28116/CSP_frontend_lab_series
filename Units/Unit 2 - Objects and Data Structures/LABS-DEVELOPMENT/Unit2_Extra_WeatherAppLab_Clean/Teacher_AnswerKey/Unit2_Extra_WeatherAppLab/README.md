# Weather App Lab – Matrix Data Simulation (Teacher)

## Overview
Students generate and visualize a 10×10 matrix of random temperatures. They practice nested loops, conditionals, DOM rendering with emojis, and simple data analysis.

## Flow
1. Review matrices and nested loops (from 2.2 Matrices PDF).
2. Create 10×10 grid of temps (60–100°F).
3. Classify to 🔥 / ☁️ / ❄️.
4. Render with CSS Grid.
5. Compute Avg/Min/Max and display.

## Coaching Tips
- Emphasize function design and single responsibility.
- Encourage threshold tweaks to see quick UI changes.
- For differentiation, track counts of hot/mild/cold cells.

## Stretch Ideas
- Animate multiple days (setInterval).
- Heat map with numeric labels.
- Export data to CSV using Blob API.
