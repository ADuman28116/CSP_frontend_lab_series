# Weather App Lab – Matrix Data Simulation (10×10)

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Represent weather data using a 2D matrix (10×10).
- Traverse a matrix using nested loops to compute aggregates.
- Classify values with conditionals (hot/mild/cold).
- Render data visually using DOM + CSS Grid and emojis.

---

## 📖 Pre‑Lab Reading
Reference: `2.2_JS_Advanced_Data_Types_Matrices.pdf`  
Focus on: creating 2D arrays, accessing rows/columns, nested loops.

---

## 🧰 Setup
1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Open `src/index.html` with a browser (or Live Server).
3. Click **Generate Weather** after you implement the functions in `Lab2_Extra_MatricesWeatherApp.js`.

---

## 📝 Tasks
1. Build a 10×10 matrix of random temperatures (60–100°F).
2. Classify each cell to one of: `🔥` (≥90), `☁️` (71–89), `❄️` (≤70).
3. Render the 10×10 emoji grid using CSS Grid.
4. Compute and display **Avg / Min / Max** for the dataset.
5. Keep your code modular: `makeWeatherData`, `classify`, `render`, `analyze`, `renderStats`.

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals
- Add a **Regenerate** button to animate daily changes.
- Show **hot/mild/cold counts** under the grid.
- Add a **slider** to change grid size (e.g., 8×8 to 15×15).

## 🎟 Exit Ticket
1. Why do we need nested loops to analyze a 10×10 grid?
2. How would you change thresholds or ranges without editing rendering logic?
3. What would be the pros/cons of showing numeric temperatures vs emojis?
4. How could you simulate a week of weather and show trends?
